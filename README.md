## __About Me__

#### My Interests
* Reading - I have a small house library of about 125 books I have collected over the past decade.  
* Gardening - A big goal of mine is to create a food forest in my yard, it will take years.

#### Websites I frequent
* [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) - Lately I've been listening to Lofi channels as I do homework, but my most frequently watched channels are *tzuyang쯔양* and *Pokemon Kids TV*, last one is the toddler.
* [Royal Road](https://www.royalroad.com/home) - Royal Road is a web novel site where I've been reading *Mother of Learning*, it's a long one but so far well worth it.
